## ‚úÖ Overview

This report documents the deployment and monitoring of a simple Node.js microservice containerized using Docker, orchestrated via Kubernetes, and hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The application includes enhanced logging via Winston and is monitored using GCP‚Äôs Stackdriver Monitoring and Logging (now called Cloud Monitoring and Logging).

## üì¶ Application Summary

A Node.js-based microservice exposes three endpoints:

- `/power?num1=2&num2=3` ‚Äì Exponentiation
- `/sqrt?num=16` ‚Äì Square root
- `/modulo?num1=10&num2=3` ‚Äì Modulo operation

Logs are handled via Winston and sent to standard output for visibility in GCP Log Explorer.

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Dockerization
- Wrote a `Dockerfile` based on `node:18-alpine`.
- Used `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files.
- Built and pushed image to Docker Hub:  
  `sireeshasn/enhanced-calculator:latest`

### 2. Kubernetes Deployment
- Created `deployment.yaml` and `service.yaml`.
- Deployed to GKE Autopilot cluster in region `australia-southeast1` using:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
  kubectl apply -f service.yaml
